## 📝 Project Description

**Battle of Ships** is a strategy game where the goal is to locate and destroy an opponent's ships before they destroy yours. This version features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing, allowing for interactive gameplay.

-   Players (either two human players or one human player against an AI) set up their boards by placing ships.
-   Players take turns firing at coordinates on the opponent's grid.
-   Visual feedback is provided for hits, misses, and sunk ships using images and GIFs.
-   The game includes different weapon types with varying effects.
-   The first player to sink all enemy ships wins.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as:
-   **Encapsulation**
-   **Abstraction**
-   **Inheritance**
-   **Polymorphism**

## 🌟 Features

-   Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive gameplay.
-   Two game modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI.
-   Interactive ship placement on a grid.
-   Weapon purchasing system with a budget.
-   Variety of weapons (Basic Attack, Missiles, Bomb) with different attack patterns.
-   Visual feedback with images and GIFs for ships, hits, misses, and sunk ships.
-   Game state logging to console and potentially to file.
-   "Reveal My Ships" option for the current player.

## 🧱 Class Overview

### Core Game Logic (`core` package)

* **`Player.java`**: Represents a player, managing their board, ships, budget, and inventory of weapons. Handles actions like placing ships, buying weapons, and using weapons.
* **`PlayerAI.java`**: Extends `Player` to implement an artificial intelligence opponent capable of automatically placing ships, purchasing weapons, and making attack decisions.
* **`Board.java`**: Represents the game grid for each player. Manages the state of cells (water, ship, hit, miss) and validates ship placements and attacks.
* **`Cell.java`**: Represents a single cell on the game board, tracking whether it contains a ship part and if it has been hit.
* **`Weapon.java` *(abstract)***: An abstract base class defining common properties (name, price) and behavior (`use` method) for all weapons.
* **`BasicAttack.java`**: A concrete weapon type, likely representing a standard, free attack.
* **`Missile.java`**: A concrete weapon type. Can be vertical or horizontal, attacking an entire row or column.
* **`Bomb.java`**: A concrete weapon type, attacking a 3x3 area (as per `Bomb.java` logic, not 5x5 as in initial description).
* **`WeaponType.java` *(enum)***: Defines the different types of weapons available in the game, along with their names, prices, and display names.
* **`WeaponFactory.java`**: A factory class responsible for creating instances of different weapon types.
* **`GameController.java`**: Manages the game flow for a console-based version of the game (likely the original implementation).
* **`SeaBattleGUI.java`**: The main class for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) version of the game. It handles user interactions, displays the game state, and integrates with the core game logic classes. It manages game phases, player turns, and AI interaction.
* **`Main.java`**: Potentially the original entry point for the console version of the game or for initial testing.

### Exception Handling (`exceptions` package)

* **`AlreadyAttackedException.java`**: Thrown when an attempt is made to attack a cell that has already been hit.
* **`IllegalWeaponTypeException.java`**: Thrown for invalid weapon type selections or purchase attempts.
* **`InvalidInputException.java`**: (As per screenshot) Likely used for handling general invalid user input, possibly in the console version.
* **`InvalidPlacementException.java`**: Thrown when a ship placement violates game rules (e.g., out of bounds, on another ship, adjacent to another ship).

### File I/O (`fileIO` package)

* **`FileLogger.java`**: Handles logging game events (history, errors) to files, likely stored in the `LOGS` directory.

### Resources (`images` package)

* Contains image files (`.png`, `.gif`) used for the game's visual elements, such as the board background, ship appearances, sunk ship animations, and splash effects.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    * Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (e.g., JDK 11 or newer).
    * An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code (optional, but recommended for ease of use).
2.  **Compile the Code**:
    * Navigate to the `src` directory in your terminal.
    * Compile all Java files:
        ```bash
        javac core/*.java exceptions/*.java fileIO/*.java
        ```
      (If `SeaBattleGUI.java` is in the `core` package, it will be compiled. If it's in the default package directly under `src`, compile it separately: `javac SeaBattleGUI.java core/*.java ...`)
3.  **Run the Game**:
    * The primary entry point for the GUI version is likely `SeaBattleGUI.java`.
    * From the directory containing the compiled `core` package (usually `src` or a `bin`/`out` folder if using an IDE):
        ```bash
        java core.SeaBattleGUI
        ```
    * Ensure the `images` folder is accessible in the classpath (e.g., in the same directory as the `core` package when running, or configured as a resource folder in your IDE).

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements (Suggestions can be discussed)

* More sophisticated AI strategies.
* Network multiplayer functionality.
* More diverse weapon types or special abilities.
* Enhanced sound effects and visual animations.
